## Remaining Work (8 Projects - 25%)

### Phase 4: Well-Documented - Needs Final Review (8 projects)
These projects already have decent documentation but need final template compliance review and minor enhancements:

1. **sharothee-wedding.md** - Wedding website, needs full template structure
2. **githubreadtool.md** - GitHub toolkit, needs feature expansion
3. **storm-funnel.md** - SaaS funnel builder, needs enhancement
4. **sr600mini.md** - POS terminal, needs comprehensive docs
5. **walkin.md** - Hotel website (different from walkinroom), needs details
6. **netcon-pyvue.md** - Microservices project, needs expansion
7. **sr600mini-v1.md** - Embedded payment system, needs details
8. **cbrms.md** - Laravel project, needs comprehensive docs
9. **tailone.md** - Template project, needs expansion
10. **special-space-goldfish.md** - Next.js project, needs details

**Note:** Some projects (sharothee-wedding, githubreadtool, storm-funnel) have partial good documentation but need full template compliance.

## Timeline Estimate

Based on current progress:
- **Completed:** 13 projects (~40 hours of work)
- **Remaining:** 19 projects

## Notes

### Common Patterns Identified
1. **Laravel Projects:** Many projects use Laravel framework with similar HTML badges
2. **Academic Projects:** CSE course projects need academic context added
3. **Full-Stack Projects:** Laravel + Next.js/Vue combinations need both tech stacks documented
4. **Specialized Systems:** POS, billing, eKYC systems need domain-specific features highlighted

### Lessons Learned
1. Creating a comprehensive template first saved significant time
2. Batching similar projects (e.g., all Laravel projects) is efficient
3. Removing HTML is straightforward; adding meaningful content requires research
4. Categories and tags significantly improve project discoverability
5. Build verification after each batch prevents regression issues
