## Timeline Estimate

Based on current progress:
- **Completed:** 13 projects (~40 hours of work)
- **Remaining:** 19 projects
- **Estimated time to complete:**
  - Phase 3 completion (10 projects): ~16 hours
  - Phase 4 review (11 projects): ~8 hours
  - Phase 5 QA: ~4 hours
  - **Total remaining: ~28 hours**

## Notes

### Common Patterns Identified
1. **Laravel Projects:** Many projects use Laravel framework with similar HTML badges
2. **Academic Projects:** CSE course projects need academic context added
3. **Full-Stack Projects:** Laravel + Next.js/Vue combinations need both tech stacks documented
4. **Specialized Systems:** POS, billing, eKYC systems need domain-specific features highlighted

### Lessons Learned
1. Creating a comprehensive template first saved significant time
2. Batching similar projects (e.g., all Laravel projects) is efficient
3. Removing HTML is straightforward; adding meaningful content requires research
4. Categories and tags significantly improve project discoverability
5. Build verification after each batch prevents regression issues
