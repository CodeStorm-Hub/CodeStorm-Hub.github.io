  4: 'var(--space-4)',   // 16px
  8: 'var(--space-8)',   // 32px
} as const;

// Typography System (From Geist Font Research)
const typographyVariants = cva("", {
  variants: {
    variant: {
      h1: "text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold tracking-tight",
      body: "text-base leading-relaxed",
      muted: "text-sm text-muted-foreground",
    },
  },
});

// Accessibility Implementation (From Radix UI Research)
export function SkipLinks() {
  return (
    <div className="fixed top-4 left-4 z-50">
      {skipLinks.map((link) => (
        <a
          key={link.href}
          href={link.href}
          className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only"
        >
          {link.label}
        </a>
