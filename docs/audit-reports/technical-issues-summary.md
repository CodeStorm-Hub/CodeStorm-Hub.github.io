## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Missing Error Boundaries

**Issue:** No error boundary components implemented
**Impact:** Uncaught errors could crash entire application
**Recommendation:** Implement error boundaries for major sections

### 2. Limited TypeScript Type Coverage

**Issue:** Some components could benefit from stricter typing
**Current State:** Basic TypeScript implementation
**Improvement:** Enhanced type definitions, stricter configurations

### 3. Missing Loading States

**Issue:** No loading states for data fetching operations
**Impact:** Poor user experience during data loading
**Recommendation:** Add loading spinners and skeleton states

### 4. No Error Handling for External Links

**Issue:** External links (GitHub, social media) have no error handling
**Impact:** Broken links lead to poor user experience
**Recommendation:** Add link validation and error states

---

## Infrastructure and Deployment Issues

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration

**Issue:** Limited environment variable setup
**Current State:** Basic `.env.example` file
**Needs:** Production environment configuration

### 2. No Monitoring Setup

**Issue:** No error tracking or performance monitoring
**Impact:** Issues in production may go undetected
**Recommendation:** Implement monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)

### 3. Missing CI/CD Pipeline

**Issue:** No automated testing or deployment pipeline
**Current State:** Manual deployment process
**Recommendation:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Testing Coverage Needed
