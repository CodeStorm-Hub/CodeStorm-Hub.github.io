# CodeStorm Hub Portfolio Website

CodeStorm Hub is a vibrant community of open source enthusiasts, researchers, and creators. We collaborate on powerful open-source solutions.

This is the official portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI, featuring a modern design system inspired by Vercel's design engineering practices.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) with App Router
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **Components**: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com)
- **Typography**: [Geist Font](https://vercel.com/font)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (automated via GitHub Actions)

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
